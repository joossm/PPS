# struct:
```
using System;

struct s {
    public int foo;
    public string bar;
}

class Program
{
    static void Main() {
        s x = new s(); 
        x.foo = 3;
        x.bar = "bar";
        s y = x;
        y.bar = "foo";
        Console.WriteLine (x.bar);
    }
}
```
The code creates a struct named `s`, which contains two fields: `foo` and `bar`. It then creates two instances of `s`, `x` and `y`. It assigns the value `3` to the field `foo` in `x`, and the value `"bar"` to the field `bar` in `x`. Finally, it assigns `y` to `x`, and then changes the value of the `bar` field in `y` to `"foo"`.

The result of the code is that the value of `x.bar` is `"foo"`.

# class:
```
using System;

struct s {
    public int foo;
    public string bar;
}

class Program
{
    static void Main() {
        s x = new s(); 
        x.foo = 3;
        x.bar = "bar";
        s y = x;
        y.bar = "foo";
        Console.WriteLine (x.bar);
    }
}
The code above creates a new struct `s`, with two fields `foo` and `bar`. It then creates a new instance of `s` called `x`, and sets the value of `x.foo` to 3 and `x.bar` to `"bar"`. It then creates a new instance of `s` called `y`, and sets it equal to `x`. Finally, it changes the value of `y.bar` to `"foo"`.

The output of this code is `"foo"`.
